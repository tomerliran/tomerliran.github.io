# MMP-Antikythera-Mechanism
Major Project

Structure of files:

img file includes all the images and models that are on the website can be found (in addition some model attempts can be found).

js file includes all the JavaScript included, including third party libraries that are allowed to be distributed.

index.html and model.html are the HTML files that can be viewed by any browser. 

The stylesheets.css file contains the CSS code for the aesthetics aspect of the webpage.

Running: 

To run the web application, double-click (open) the index.html file and everything will appear as supposed to in the browser.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:

The model.html page will not work if run from a local directory (by opening the files locally) because you are just opening html documents directly from the browser. To fix this you will need to serve your code from a webserver and access it on localhost for the graphics to work. 

Or simply visit the site that's run on a server already https://tomerliran.github.io/

The website that's already running on the github server (https://tomerliran.github.io/) has not been manipulated since Mid-April to prove the project's integrity and authenticity since this error is appearing. The dates can be seen on the github repository https://github.com/tomerliran/tomerliran.github.io
